# Data for ATP and WTA tours (match results and rankings, 1980s onwards)

Data is saved in under two separate folders for men (`atp`) and women (`wta`). The files are in `.csv` format. They form a subset of the entire dataset (always being updated) available at 
https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_wta
and 
https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp .

Each folder contains its separate `readme.md` file, describing the variables contained in the data files. There are two kinds of file in each case -- there is one file for rankings, and then several files tracking match statistics in a calendar year (one for each year).
