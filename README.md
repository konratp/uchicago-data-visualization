# MACS 40700 - Data Visualization


## Description of the Repository

This repository contains all homework sets, a midterm- and a final project for Dr. Benjamin Soltoff's (@bensoltoff) course on Data Visualization at @uchicago, which I completed during the Spring quarter of 2022 as part of the [Masters of Arts Program in the Social Sciences (MAPSS)](https://mapss.uchicago.edu/). Over the course of nine weeks, I gained an understanding of core principles of designing and creating effective data visualizations, learned to use visualizations for the evaluation of statistical models and for statistical inference, and mastered R -- especially `ggplot2` -- through the creation of powerful static and dynamic data visualizations. You can find all information on the course (including a detailed syllabus and list of assignments) on [the course website](https://uc-dataviz.netlify.app/index.html). If you have any questions about the code in this repository, please feel free to contact me at [kpekkip@uchicago.edu](mailto:kpekkip@uchicago.edu).


## Structure of the Repository

This repository contains three major subdirectories, [`homework_sets`](homework_sets), [`midterm_project`](midterm_project), and [`final_project`](final_project). The midterm and final projects were collaborative efforts, while homework sets were completed invidually. You can find specific information on each of the assignments in the `README.md` files of each subdirectory, or on [the course website](https://uc-dataviz.netlify.app/index.html).


## Theoretical Foundations

Leland Wilkinson's *The Grammar of Graphics* presents the theoretical core of this class, while Hadley Wickham's [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/) is used as a hands-on toolkit for creating visualizations in accordance with the principles laid out by Wilkinson using R and `ggplot2`.
