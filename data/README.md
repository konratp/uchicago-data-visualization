# Data for ATP and WTA tours (match results and rankings, 1980s onwards)

Data is saved in under two separate folders for men (`atp`) and women (`wta`). The files are in `.csv` format. They form a subset of the entire dataset (always being updated) available at  
https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_wta  
and  
https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp .

Each folder contains its separate `readme.md` file describing the variables contained in the data files. 
There are two kinds of data files in each folder -- there is one file for rankings (called `rankings.csv`), 
and then several files tracking match statistics in a calendar year (one file for each year).
